  <main>
    <p>We’ve always been interested in the question of whether it’s possible to find some better way of meaningfully alleviating psychic pain.</p>
    <p>Undoubtedly, our childhood experiences contributed to our interest. More than a few of us were raised in less-than-ideal emotional environments, including bearing witness to parents locked in tragic emotional pain from which they would never escape.</p>
    <p>We knew that lots of decent people outside of our families were also getting caught up in tragic cycles.</p>
    <p>In addition, we realized pretty early on that we weren’t happy with the spiritual track society was on.</p>
    <p>What we didn’t fully anticipate — but came to see as we started recording our thoughts (spoken notes) and gradually got better at being honest with ourselves — was our own personal risk of “losing” in the emotional/spiritual contest. Worse than just living in more negative emotion than we found acceptable, we realized we were running the risk of never trying with a level of effort we could feel okay about. We realized we needed help as much or more than anyone. And this helped push us.</p>

    <p>After a lot of bad ideas, we finally found one we didn’t hate a few months later:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Talk out loud to yourself or your God and record it.</li>
      <li>Get paired with a stranger the next day — and hear part of what each other said.</li>
      <li>Once in a while, share something honest from one person with the whole community.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But we had day jobs. We’re also not as smart as we’d like. And it took us a while before we even started trying the core experience of our idea for ourselves (i.e., recording our thoughts/prayers). At first, it was mainly in desperation that we turned to it. We disliked how we sounded when we described the idea to others or tried to write about it. The whole mental health/spirituality space is a minefield of clichés and other forms of bad taste, and we didn’t know how to steer clear of it.</p>

    <p>It took years.</p>
    <p>We’re a small team. We’re self-funded. We’re not rich. We have decent educations. And we need help — both in testing this idea and in living in greater peace with ourselves.</p>
    <p>We’d be super grateful if you stuck around and helped us.</p>
