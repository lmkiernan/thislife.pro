    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>The more honest people can be with themselves on This Life, the more This Life can work—helping us each live with greater peace toward ourselves and reality.</p>
    
    <p>We understand that spoken notes are often deeply personal. We'll protect this information with as much care—human and technical—as we can.</p>
    
    <p>We will never sell, transfer, or use your data for any outside purpose. We will never feature a spoken note publicly (e.g., as a "One of the Day") without your explicit permission. Below is a technical overview of how we protect your data.</p>
    
    <h2>This Life: Technical Infrastructure & Data Privacy</h2>
    
    <h3>Hosting & Security</h3>
    <p>All services run on Amazon Web Services (AWS)—the same secure cloud infrastructure trusted by hospitals, banks, and governments. Key protections include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AES-256 encryption at rest</li>
        <li>TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit</li>
        <li>FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography</li>
        <li>SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 compliance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Encryption</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>At Rest:</strong> Data is encrypted with AES-256.</li>
        <li><strong>In Transit:</strong> Data is protected via TLS with Perfect Forward Secrecy.</li>
        <li>Encryption keys are managed through AWS KMS with strict access controls.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Access Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Access is limited by role and only granted if necessary.</li>
        <li>All admin access requires multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
        <li>Every access event is logged and regularly reviewed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Data Retention</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Data is stored in U.S.-based AWS data centers.</li>
        <li>We automatically delete obsolete data and securely erase upon request.</li>
        <li>We retain data only as long as required by law or for product functionality—no longer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Third Parties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not share or sell personal data.</li>
        <li>We only use trusted infrastructure partners (e.g., AWS), under strict processing agreements.</li>
        <li>No cross-border data transfers without explicit user consent.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>User Rights</h3>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@thislife.app">privacy@thislife.app</a>. We'll verify and fulfill your request unless legal retention is required.</p>
    
    <p><strong>We engineer for trust.</strong><br>
    Security and privacy are built into every layer of This Life—from our code to our policies to the choices we make about how this app is used.</p>
